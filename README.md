# Introduction to Engineering

### Overview
This repository hosts materials for Mr. Enrico's _Intro to Engineering_ class at North Bergen High School. Like the course itself,
this repo is a work in progress and subject to frequent change. Generally speaking, the `/notes` folder contains class notes, the `/examples` folder contains short sample exercises that support lessons in the `/notes` folder, and the `/assignments` folder includes unsolved problems with doctests for self-checking.
