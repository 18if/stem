# You may assume that the file is formatted in such a way that each number is an integer and occupies its own line.
# You may not assume you know how many numbers are in the file.

# The file numbers.txt in this directory follows these guidelines and should add up to 4753817
# After you've written your function, you can run test.py to ensure your function works on other files as well.
